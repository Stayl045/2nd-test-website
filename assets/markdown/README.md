## Reflection

I found this assignment particularily engaging and fun! This time around, I had to really reflect on how to wrap my head around grid.

- As I mentioned in Journal Entry, I found some help on YouTube on how to understand grid better.
  - This allowed me to creete a design that I felt comfortable creating.
- I was also inspired by the likes of Apple and various other popular webpages as my main layout.
  - I am the kind of guy who likes more simple layouts. In my eyes, this allows the flare to more more easiliy.

### Other Notes

- various flares are present from `box-shadow` to `media-query` adjustments for smaller window sizes.
